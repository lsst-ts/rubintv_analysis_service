  - name: ExposureInfo
    index_column: exposure_id
    columns:
      - name: exposure_id
        datatype: long
        description: Unique identifier of an exposure.
      - name: seq_num
        datatype: long
        description: Sequence number
      - name: ra
        datatype: double
        unit: degree
        description: RA of focal plane center.
      - name: dec
        datatype: double
        unit: degree
        description: Declination of focal plane center
      - name: expTime
        datatype: double
        description: Spatially-averaged duration of exposure, accurate to 10ms.
      - name: physical_filter
        datatype: char
        description: ID of physical filter,
          the filter associated with a particular instrument.
      - name: obsNight
        datatype: date
        description: The night of the observation. This is different than the
          observation date, as this is the night that the observations started,
          so for observations after midnight obsStart and obsNight will be
          different days.
      - name: obsStart
        datatype: datetime
        description: Start time of the exposure at the fiducial center
          of the focal plane array, TAI, accurate to 10ms.
      - name: obsStartMJD
        datatype: double
        description: Start of the exposure in MJD, TAI, accurate to 10ms.
